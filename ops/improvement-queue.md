# Improvement Queue

Things to fix or improve, queued for the next work session.

## Format
```
- [ ] [PRIORITY] [Description] — [Action note]
```

Priority: P0 (fix now), P1 (this week), P2 (when available)

## Open

_Add items here as you find them._

<!-- Example:
- [ ] P1 Cost report script not parsing OpenAI usage — check API response format
- [ ] P2 Add voice transcription skill — research Whisper local vs API
-->

## Completed (last 7 days)

_Move items here when done._

---

## Rules
- **Found it = fix it** — if it takes <10 min, do it now, don't queue
- **One-line action note required** — "fix the thing" is not actionable
- **P0 = blocking something** — gets done before anything else
- **Review weekly** — prune stale items, promote important ones
