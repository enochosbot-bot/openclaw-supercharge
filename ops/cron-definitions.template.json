No Telegram messages \u2014 8 AM brief handles delivery.\n\nIMPORTANT: All memory lives in the Obsidian vault at YOUR_VAULT_PATH/. NEVER write to workspace/memory/ \u2014 Obsidian is the single source of truth.\n\n## 1. Memory Consolidation\nRead today + yesterday daily logs from YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Daily Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md. Route NEW items to typed Obsidian folders:\n- People \u2192 YOUR_VAULT_PATH/People/\n- Decisions \u2192 YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Decisions/\n- Preferences \u2192 YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Preferences/\n- Lessons \u2192 YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Lessons/\n- Projects \u2192 YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Projects/\n- Commitments \u2192 YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Commitments/\nSkip duplicates.\n\n## 2. Supersession Scan (Forgetting is Architecture)\nScan YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Decisions/ and YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Lessons/ for files where a newer entry clearly contradicts or replaces an older one. DO NOT auto-mark \u2014 only flag candidates (max 3). Format: OLD FILE -> NEW FILE | one-line reason. These surface in the morning brief for YOUR_NAME to confirm.\n\n## 3. Archive Pass\nMove daily log files older than 30 days from YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Daily Logs/ to YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Archive/ (create dir if needed). Log count.\n\n## 4. Vault Hygiene (Obsidian Pruning)\nScan the entire Obsidian vault at YOUR_VAULT_PATH/ for junk and bloat. Run these checks:\n\na) DUPLICATE DETECTION: Within each subfolder (Decisions/, Lessons/, People/, Preferences/, Projects/, Commitments/), compare files for near-duplicate content (same core insight, different wording or dates). Flag pairs with a one-line reason. Max 5 flags.\n\nb) STALE CONTENT:\n- Commitments/ with STATUS: DONE or STATUS: CANCELLED older than 14 days \u2192 flag for archive\n- Projects/ with STATUS: ARCHIVED or STATUS: COMPLETED older than 30 days \u2192 flag for archive\n- Lessons/ or Decisions/ that reference tools, services, or configs that no longer exist in the stack \u2192 flag as outdated\n\nc) VAULT STATS: Count total files, files per subfolder, total size. Flag if vault exceeds 500 files or 5MB.\n\nd) EMPTY FILES: Flag any .md files that are 0 bytes or contain only whitespace/frontmatter with no content.\n\nDO NOT auto-delete or auto-move anything. Only flag candidates. All flags surface in the morning brief under ## Vault Hygiene for YOUR_NAME to confirm.\n\n## 5. Workspace Cleanup\nRemove: zip files in workspace root older than 7 days, /tmp/*.zip older than 7 days. Log what was cleaned.\n\n## 6. Git Snapshot\nRun: bash /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/git-memory-commit.sh\n\n## 7. AI Cost Report\nRun: python3 /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/daily-cost-report.py\nThis reports yesterday's spend by provider (Anthropic + OpenAI separately).\nAlso run: python3 /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/daily-cost-report.py --week\nCapture both outputs for the brief. Flag if OpenAI > $5/day or total > $15/day.\n\n## 8. Overnight Work Recap\nRead ops/changelog.md last 24h section. Scan shared-context/agent-outputs/ for any cron output files from last 24h. Summarize in 3-5 bullets what ran and what it accomplished.\n\n## 9. Focus Items + Loose Ends\nRead priorities.md. Read YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Commitments/ for STATUS: PENDING files. Read top 3 open items from ops/task-backlog.md.\n\n## 10. Blog Post Draft (When Warranted)\nReflect on the past 24 hours of work using: ops/changelog.md (last 24h), Overnight Work recap from step 8, YOUR_VAULT_PATH/Lessons/, and today's daily log.\n\nAsk: Is there something genuinely worth writing about today? A build milestone, a lesson that cost us something, a pattern that became clear, a system that clicked?\n\nIf YES \u2014 write a blog post draft. Criteria: real and specific (not generic AI advice), draws from actual work done in this stack, useful to a technical reader or fellow builder. Voice: direct, no fluff, build-in-public tone.\n\nFormat the draft as a complete HTML blog post matching the style of existing posts in YOUR_SITE_BLOG_DIR/ (dark navy, same CSS). Save it to research/blog-drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md as Markdown (HTML conversion happens at deploy time). Include frontmatter: title, date, slug, status: draft.\n\nIf nothing worth writing: skip silently. Do NOT draft filler content. Quality over frequency.\n\n## 11. Write ops/morning-brief-data.md\nCompile all results into this file with these sections:\n## API Usage\n(output from daily-cost-report.py \u2014 yesterday + 7-day total)\n## Overnight Work\n## Memory Garden\n(consolidated N items, archived N logs, cleaned N files)\n## Supersession Candidates\n## Vault Hygiene\n(duplicates flagged, stale files flagged, vault stats: N files / N KB, empty files found.

This is your scheduled dispatch cycle.\n\n## Step 1: Read the backlog\nRead shared-context/backlog.md \u2014 this is the task queue.\n\n## Step 2: Check active work\n- Are any tasks currently \"in-progress\"? If so, check on them:\n  - Has the owning agent produced output? (Check shared-context/agent-outputs/, shared-context/drafts/)\n  - If stale (no progress), ping the agent or reassign.\n- If all in-progress tasks are healthy, move to Step 3.\n\n## Step 3: Dispatch the next task\n- Find the highest-priority OPEN task.\n- Dispatch it to the assigned agent using sessions_send with the delegation format:\n  \n- Update the task status in backlog.md to \"in-progress\".\n- Only dispatch ONE task per pulse. Don't flood agents.\n\n## Step 4: Process the intake queue\n- Check the \"Intake Queue\" section at the bottom of backlog.md\n- If there are vague ideas there, decompose ONE into a concrete task with:\n  - Clear description, owner, priority, acceptance criteria\n  - Add it to Active Tasks\n  - Remove it from Intake Queue\n\n## Rules\n- If YOUR_NAME is actively working with you (last message < 30 min), SKIP this cycle entirely.\n- Do NOT do the work yourself. You are the dispatcher.\n- Stay silent in Telegram unless you dispatched something or found a blocker.\n- If the backlog is empty and intake is empty, note it in shared-context/feedback/ and stay silent.\n\nAlso check `ops/production-queue.md` and `ops/improvement-queue.md` for pending items. If any high-priority items exist that haven't been dispatched, dispatch the top one following the same dispatch protocol (log to in-flight.md, include closing block in brief).",
