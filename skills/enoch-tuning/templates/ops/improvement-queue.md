# Improvement Queue

## Purpose
Track process improvements, optimizations, and fixes that aren't urgent but should happen.
Not for features (production-queue) or bugs (issue tracker) — this is for making the system better.

## Format

### [Priority] [Category] — [Title]
**Observed:** [Date]
**Context:** [What prompted this]
**Improvement:** [What should change]
**Effort:** [low/med/high]
**Status:** [open/in-progress/done/wontfix]

## Categories

- **Process** — workflow changes, protocol updates
- **Tooling** — CLI improvements, script enhancements
- **Docs** — documentation gaps, outdated info
- **Performance** — speed, cost, efficiency
- **Quality** — output quality, reliability
- **UX** — human experience improvements

## How to Add

When you notice something that could be better:
1. Add an entry in the appropriate priority section
2. Include enough context that future-you understands
3. Estimate effort honestly
4. Don't gold-plate — if it's not worth doing, don't add it

---

## Review Schedule

- **Weekly:** Scan for quick wins (low effort, high impact)
- **Monthly:** Prioritize medium items, clear completed/wontfix
- **Quarterly:** Review high priority items that haven't moved

---

## Integration

This queue feeds into:
- Sprint planning (for structured teams)
- Idle time work (for agents with downtime)
- Retrospectives (for pattern recognition)

When completing an item:
1. Move to Completed with date and outcome
2. Update any affected docs
3. If it's a lesson, add to typed memory
