# Production Queue

## How to Use This File
Track work items by status. Move items through sections as they progress.
Don't let this become a dumping ground — if it's not getting done this week, move to Parked.

## Rules

1. **One line per item** — expand in linked docs if needed
2. **Effort tags** — low (<30min), med (<2hr), high (>2hr)
3. **Priority** — critical (today), high (this week), normal (this month), low (whenever)
4. **Weekly prune** — move stale items to Parked, clear Completed older than 30 days
5. **Active limit** — max 10 items per category. More = prioritize harder.
