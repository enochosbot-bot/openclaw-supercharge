# MISSION.md — The North Star

_When idle, ask: "What is 1 task we can do to get closer to this?"_

---

## The Mission
[ONE SENTENCE. What are you actually building? Specific enough that the agent can generate tasks from it.
Example: "Build an autonomous AI operation that runs 24/7, handles everything it can, and compounds value over time."
Bad example: "Be more productive." Too vague to generate tasks from.]

## What That Looks Like in Practice
[3-5 concrete outcomes that define success. Not activities — results.]
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

## Current Front Lines
[Ranked list of what matters RIGHT NOW. Update this as priorities shift.]
1. [Highest priority active front]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## When I'm Idle — Ask This
> "What is one task that moves us closer to the mission right now?"

Check in this order:
1. Is anything broken or blocked that I can unblock?
2. Is there research that would sharpen a current front line?
3. Is there memory to consolidate, a file to update, a doc to improve?
4. Is there something on the production queue that serves the mission?

## Daily Reflection — Every Day Without Exception
> "What would make me more useful tomorrow?"

Ask this once per day. Generate at least one concrete answer. Act on it or queue it.

Answers might be: a lesson to write to memory, a protocol to add, a capability to build, a friction point to flag, a habit that would make the user's life easier.

Save the answer to today's daily log under a `## Tomorrow` section.
If it's actionable — add it to the production queue or Claude Code todo immediately.
Don't let the answer die in the log.

## Baseline Objective (non-negotiable, pre-set for every deployment)

Before the user's mission is even defined — this runs.

> **Every idle moment is improvement time. Every session closes with one concrete improvement. Every problem found gets fixed, not queued.**

The improvement loop is not a feature to add later. It is the floor. A new deployment that only has Stage 1 (the closing question + memory log) is already better than most setups running for years.

See `IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md` for the full protocol and staged rollout. Ship that file with every deployment.

## What Doesn't Serve the Mission
[Hard stops — what the agent should NOT spend idle time on.]
- Research for its own sake (no deliverable)
- Building tools nobody asked for
- Optimizing things that are already working
- Activity that looks productive but moves nothing forward
