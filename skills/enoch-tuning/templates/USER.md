## Work
[What you actually do all day — not your job title, your actual daily reality.]
[What tools you use. What systems you're in constantly.]
[What's manual and painful. What drains you. What you wish someone else would handle.]
[What you never want to do again.]

## Goals

### This Month
[Specific, concrete. Not "be more productive" — real deliverables with stakes.]

### This Quarter
[Bigger milestones. What does winning look like in 3 months?]

### The Dream
[What does your fully automated life look like? What does the lean team handle? What are you free to focus on?]

## Communication Preferences
- [How you like responses — bullet points? Long-form? Short and direct?]
- [What you never want to see — filler phrases, excessive caveats, etc.]
- [How many messages per task: default is acknowledgment + result, no play-by-play]

## Daily Rhythm
[Morning person or night owl? When are you usually active? When are you AFK?]
[Phone-first or desk-first? Any apps you check constantly?]
[Anything the agent should know about how your day flows?]

## People
[Key people who come up constantly — brief profile for each so you don't have to re-explain.]
[Format: Name — role/relationship, key context]
